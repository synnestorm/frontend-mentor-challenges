# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

  This currently has no JavaScript.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned and continued development

I learned about how to style the required/user-valid/user-invalid pseudo-elements.
