# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned and continued development

This was an interesting one! I used flexbox, but I also had a lot of fun with using position:relative. I learned a lot about how you can position things inside flex using
relative.
