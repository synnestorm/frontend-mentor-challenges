# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about: linear-gradient backgrounds, about hsla and continue to learn flexbox. I don't know anything about .json yet, but the file is there.
