# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about the use of flexbox, and how it works.

### Continued development

I definitely need to practice positioning, the CSS box model and how to style images more. I struggled a bit with perfectly aligning the image and the div (.info), and I dont know how to do this.
