# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned and continued development

I learned more about the hover state, and how to add it to images. I need to practice more on positioning. I thought it was hard to align the icons next to the
text; I don't know the right way to do this; so please let me know if you do.
