# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Even though the image is not entirely purple (as it should be), I've learned a lot about how to use filters on images using CSS.

### Continued development

I need to practice how to put text under text, and positioning.
