# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned and continued development

I usually start with the desktop design, and make it responsive using media queries. This time I started with the mobile design, and worked
the other way around; I thought it was quite challenging.
