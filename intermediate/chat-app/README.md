# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration solution

This is a solution to [this Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load (does not have that)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned and continued development

I learned a lot about positioning, and styling of divs.
Please let me know if anything could have been done differently.
