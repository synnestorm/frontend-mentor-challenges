# Challenges from Front End Mentor

I wanted to create a repo where all the challenges I did/will do with frontend mentor could be stored.
The vision is to create a website where you can browse through all the challenges from newbie to intermediate.

This is also for practice with git, creating PRs (merges etc) and commits.
